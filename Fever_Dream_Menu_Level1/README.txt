README.txt
============

All Menu Haxe files, tilesets for Tiled, and assets must be prefixed with Menu.
All Level 1 Haxe files, tilesets for Tiled, and assets must be prefixed with L1.
Your Tiled tmx file must be called Level1.tmx and it must work with the 800 x 600px resolution we decided on as a group last week. (Replace the example Tiled files with your own.)

Failure to do this will not only break the game, but our hearts as well.

Keys:
=======
Movement - Arrow keys
Action keys - SPACE, Z, and X (You don't need to use all of these, but hopefully you don't need more)

Life:
=======
The player has 3 lives at the start of each game. This is managed with the Reg.hx file with the variable, Reg.lives. Lose all lives and the game will kick you back to the menu screen (perhaps we need a bad game over ending too? Anyone?)
